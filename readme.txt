Manage your PUBLIQ Wallet in WordPress Dashboard
 
== Description ==

PUBLIQ Wallet is the WordPress implementation of PUBLIQ Foundation's Wallet app (https://wallet.publiq.network/user/register)
Plugin communicates with PUBLIQ's servers for each action in plugin dashboard(login, signup, transfer etc.)

This plugin let's you manage your PUBLIQ wallet directly from your WordPress Website.


#Blockchain as a source of distributed trust
PUBLIQ will use its own independent blockchain based on a modified Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm. 
The blockchain will hold account related information, transactions and content metadata. 
It will also introduce and support the PUBLIQ “PBQ tokens” (cf 4-B-PBQ Token) to be used into the PUBLIQ ecosystem. 
PBQs will be partially distributed to Token Sale participants and also issued and distributed from the mining process. 
The consensus algorithm in the PUBLIQ network is PoS style, but with modifications. 
The main idea of the consensus is that miners will have a chance proportional to their stake size of being chosen to mine the next block.

Blocks will be mined every 30 seconds or 2000 operations: whichever comes first, but not faster than every 3 seconds. 
This will allow the blockchain to speed up when the number of transactions are growing and not generate lots of empty blocks when the network is idle. 
Blockchain operations in our system include PBQ transfers, content submission, daily rating adjustments, content view statistics, and other operations.

##Distributed Storage
PUBLIQ will use a distributed storage infrastructure to store all content—articles, news, and advertisements. 
Storage will consist of participants who will lend their free storage space to the PUBLIQ ecosystem in exchange for PBQ tokens. 
Becoming a distributed storage provider is an alternative way of sustaining the ecosystem and being rewarded at the same time.

#PBQ Tokens
##Main features
PUBLIQ provides a cryptocurrency utility token, “PBQ”, which can be transferred between accounts, used to purchase advertising space, and to reward participants.

The PUBLIQ instant gratification process gives the opportunity for authors to receive merit based tokens. 
Every single PBQ holders is granted with a wallet and a key pair to sign transactions. 
Authors are free to spend PBQs across the PUBLIQ ecosystem or exchange PBQ into other crypto-or-fiat currencies through the partner exchanges.

The PUBLIQ infrastructure relies on smart contracts to install trust and convenience into the reward mechanism. 
When a reader wishes to support an author, the simple fact of expressing a positive opinion will participate in improving the “PUBLIQ Score” and ultimately result in the dissemination of a larger amount of PBQ into the author’s wallet.

#PUBLIQ Governance
The PUBLIQ network self-regulates through blockchain and smart contracts, thereby eliminating influence and the need for traditional centralized authorities that have shown to be ineffective and under the control of powerful external parties.

PUBLIQ Foundation values diversity, freedom of speech, and respect for others. It wants to avoid offending readers with inappropriate articles and ads. To reach this objective, PUBLIQ Foundation introduces a mechanism of community governance to make sure the readers are protected from undesirable contents.

PUBLIQ Foundation will grant the right to the most active and appreciated authors (depending of their activity and PUBLIQ Score), from different nationalities and backgrounds, to be active members of the PUBLIQ community. The PUBLIQ community comprises 40 authors worldwide (the community will grow gradually) whose mission is to determine whether content that has received a certain number of flags may be violating the integrity of the PUBLIQ network.
